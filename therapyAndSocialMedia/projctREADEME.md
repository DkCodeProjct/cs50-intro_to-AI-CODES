# __ Binary Classification __

### Learning Project../

  * this project i did cos to get sense of what is this binary clasification and so on,, but i didnt learn it too deeply before doing the project i just follow cs50 code `example source code on banknote clasifrier`,, since im obsseced with pychoanalysis i found `menatal health and socaial media .csv` file trough [[ Kaged ]].
  With the help with tha __chatGPT__ i wrote this project,,

  + What i Learn:
        * i learn to `label data` using csv / i gave 0|1 to the data[people] that need for the therapy or don't,,   

        * also i learn `clean data`., cos in the csv file the row name and data just didnt in the correct oreder so i wrote the code to fix it as well

        * and prety much i got to get a sense about what is it mean to train a model in somewhat ,, 

        * also to use [pandas] | [sklearn] | [RandomForestClasidire]which i dint knew before
